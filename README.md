This repository is a curated, section-wise collection of practical implementations and architectural explorations in ASP.NET Core 8, inspired by the structure of the highly rated course.

⚠️ These are not reused course examples — they represent my own engineered solutions, interpretations, and code architecture practices, built from the ground up for deeper mastery.

🛠️ Technology Stack & Focus Areas

.NET 8 (LTS) – Embracing the latest in performance, minimal APIs, and native AOT
ASP.NET Core – Modular, cloud-ready web framework for modern back-end development
Entity Framework Core – Clean data access using both code-first and DB-first approaches
C# 12 – Leveraging new language features for clarity and conciseness
Dependency Injection, Middleware Pipelines, Configuration, Logging, and Modular Design Patterns

🧩 Repository Structure

Organized section-by-section based on the course outline
Focus on testable, maintainable, and production-level patterns
Hands-on implementation of core principles like SOLID, Clean Architecture, and Separation of Concerns
 Includes commentary, observations, and decisions to demonstrate design thought process

🎯 Purpose
This repo is built as a personal learning companion to:
Reinforce concepts from a professional course
Apply real coding practices with clarity
Serve as a quick-reference guide to key ASP.NET Core 8 topics
